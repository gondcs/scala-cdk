# Welcome to your CDK Scala 3 CLI project!

This is a blank project for CDK development with Scala.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It is a [Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) - [AWS CDK](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/aws-cdk) based project, so you can open this project with any compatible Scala IDE to build and run tests, and cdk to deploy it.


## Useful commands

 * `scala-cli .`     compile and run tests
 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
